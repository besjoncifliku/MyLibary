MyLibrary by Besjon Cifliku

You should be careful while connecting the database as in MY database server(used to compile my program)
I have a PASSOWRD so you should remove it from all readRW files in the project src in order to use all its features.

It has many features in Java and the connection with database is made using  JConnector 
from MySQL wich you can find in the attached file or download it online.

I have attached a copy of myLibrary schema in pdf.

It has also some constraints so you can not delete a book which is already taken
